### 13.05.2022 1.0.0 Release of Fagus on GitHub and ReadTheDocs
Now. Finally. The documentation is still not completely ready but it's time to get some feedback from the community.

### 04.05.2022 Renaming to Fagus
Checking GitHub I found that there already were several other libraries and programs having TreeO as a name which I had chosen originally. I then found another (much cooler) name which wasn't in use yet.

### 04-2022 Release getting closer
Development has been ongoing for almost a year. Documentation and testing takes time, but it is absolutely necessary for a library like this. Finally moving away from two Python-files (one for tests and one for the lib) to a proper `poetry`-project, starting to implement sphinx to parse the docstrings that had been written earlier.

### 06-2021 First idea for TreeO
Development starts, the idea to this was born writing my Bachelor's thesis where I felt that constantly writing `.get("a", {}).get("b", {}).get("c", {})` was too annoying to go on with.
